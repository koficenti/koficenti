ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Josh

ðŸŽ¹ IDE/Text Editor: IntelliJ IDEA

ðŸš€ I'm a full stack developer passionate about everything tech. My expertise lies in web technologies such as laravel (php), react (js), django (python) but also I'm familar with other stuff such as app development (java, flutter, react-native), and I enjoy drinking coffee very much while programming cool things.


ðŸ’¼ Currently looking for work so please reach out if you need a helping hand.


ðŸŒ± My end goal is to become an AI developer someday but for now stick to web dev. (*tensorflow's keras api is pretty easy but I still would like to understand the underlying math a bit more*)


ðŸ”§ Tech Stack: (I'll keep it short)
   - MEAN
   - MERN
   - LAMP
   - TALL


ðŸ“« Let's connect! Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/koficenti), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/koficenti), or check out my [Personal Website](https://astrum.today/).


Happy coding! âœ¨
